# GDPR & Privacy Compliance

This document outlines the GDPR and privacy compliance requirements for handling user data within our e-commerce platform.

## Data Protection Principles

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**
   * Process data only with valid legal basis
   * Clearly communicate processing activities to users
   * Document all data processing operations
   * Maintain transparency about data use

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   * Collect data only for specified, explicit purposes
   * Do not process data in ways incompatible with original purpose
   * Document purpose for each data category
   * Implement technical controls to enforce limitations

3. **Data Minimization**
   * Collect only data necessary for the specified purpose
   * Limit access to personal data to those who need it
   * Design forms to collect only essential information
   * Regularly review and remove unnecessary data fields

4. **Accuracy**
   * Implement validation for user-provided data
   * Allow users to review and update their data
   * Correct inaccurate data promptly
   * Maintain data quality through regular audits

5. **Storage Limitation**
   * Define retention periods for each data category
   * Automatically purge data after retention period
   * Document justification for retention periods
   * Separate operational data from archived data

6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**
   * Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   * Implement strict access controls
   * Log access to personal data
   * Regular security testing and auditing

## Data Subject Rights Implementation

1. **Right to Access**
   * Endpoint: `GET /users/me/data`
   * Collect all personal data for the user
   * Include data from all related entities
   * Format in machine-readable and human-readable formats
   * Verify identity before providing data

2. **Right to Rectification**
   * Allow users to update profile information
   * Provide mechanism to request correction of inaccurate data
   * Implement approval workflow for critical data changes
   * Notify third parties of corrections when shared

3. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**
   * Endpoint: `DELETE /users/me`
   * Implement full account deletion process
   * Anonymize data that must be retained (e.g., order history for tax purposes)
   * Cascade deletion to related entities
   * Document what is deleted vs. anonymized

4. **Right to Restrict Processing**
   * Implement account deactivation option
   * Allow granular consent withdrawal
   * Mark data as "restricted" in the database
   * Enforce restrictions in application logic

5. **Right to Data Portability**
   * Export data in structured, common format (JSON)
   * Include all user-provided data
   * Support direct transfer where technically feasible
   * Include explanatory documentation with exports

6. **Right to Object**
   * Allow users to opt out of specific processing activities
   * Implement preference center for marketing communications
   * Document objection handling process
   * Create audit trail for objections

## Consent Management

1. **Consent Collection**
   * Obtain explicit, granular consent
   * Separate consent for different purposes
   * No pre-ticked boxes or implicit consent
   * Document consent with timestamp and method

2. **Consent Storage**
   * Entity: `UserConsent`
   * Store purpose, timestamp, method, and status
   * Maintain consent history
   * Make consent records immutable

3. **Consent Withdrawal**
   * Simple process to withdraw consent
   * Immediate processing of withdrawal requests
   * Update processing systems in real-time
   * Notify processors of consent changes

4. **Consent for Children**
   * Implement age verification mechanisms
   * Require parental consent for users under 16 (or applicable age)
   * Verify parental consent with appropriate measures
   * Use age-appropriate language in consent requests

## Data Breach Response

1. **Detection**
   * Implement monitoring for unauthorized access
   * Train staff to recognize data breaches
   * Review logs and access patterns
   * Create data breach identification criteria

2. **Assessment**
   * Evaluate breach scope and severity
   * Identify affected data subjects and data types
   * Assess risk to individuals' rights and freedoms
   * Document assessment process and findings

3. **Notification**
   * Prepare to notify supervisory authority within 72 hours
   * Create notification templates for authorities
   * Develop communication plan for affected users
   * Document notification decisions and timing

4. **Remediation**
   * Close security vulnerabilities
   * Revoke compromised credentials
   * Restore affected systems to secure state
   * Implement additional controls to prevent recurrence

## Privacy by Design Implementation

1. **Technical Measures**
   * Field-level encryption for sensitive PII
   * Data anonymization for analytics
   * Automatic data purging based on retention rules
   * Audit logging for all personal data access

2. **Organizational Measures**
   * Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)
   * Maintain Records of Processing Activities (ROPA)
   * Regular privacy training for team members
   * Designate privacy responsible person(s)

3. **Default Settings**
   * Privacy-friendly defaults for user settings
   * Minimize data collection in standard forms
   * Time-limited data retention by default
   * Minimize data sharing with third parties

## Multi-Tenancy Considerations

1. **Tenant Responsibilities**
   * Clearly define processor vs. controller relationships
   * Document responsibilities in Terms of Service
   * Provide tools for tenants to comply with GDPR
   * Support tenant-specific privacy policies

2. **Regional Settings**
   * Adapt data handling based on user location
   * Implement geofencing for certain features
   * Support different consent requirements by region
   * Configure data storage locations for compliance

3. **Data Processing Agreements**
   * Establish DPAs with tenants when we act as processor
   * Maintain DPAs with our subprocessors
   * Regular review and updates to agreements
   * Monitor compliance with agreement terms

## Implementation Components

1. **Core Services**
   * `PrivacyService`: Central service for privacy operations
   * `ConsentService`: Manages consent collection and status
   * `DataExportService`: Handles data access requests
   * `DataDeletionService`: Manages right to erasure
   * `BreachNotificationService`: Coordinates breach response

2. **Database Entities**
   * `UserConsent`: Tracks consent records
   * `DataRetentionPolicy`: Configures retention periods
   * `DataAccessRequest`: Tracks access requests
   * `DataDeletionRequest`: Manages deletion workflow
   * `ProcessingActivity`: Documents processing purposes

By implementing these GDPR and privacy compliance measures, we ensure our platform respects user privacy rights and meets regulatory requirements.
