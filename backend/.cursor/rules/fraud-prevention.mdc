# Fraud Prevention & Protection

This document outlines strategies and implementations for preventing fraud and protecting both merchants and customers on the e-commerce platform.

## Risk Scoring System

### Order Risk Assessment

1. **Risk Factors**
   * Mismatch between billing and shipping addresses
   * High-value orders from new customers
   * Multiple failed payment attempts
   * Orders from high-risk countries or regions
   * Unusual shopping patterns or ordering times
   * Multiple orders with different payment methods
   * Shipping to freight forwarders or P.O. boxes

2. **Scoring Methodology**
   * Calculate cumulative risk score based on weighted factors
   * Set thresholds for automated actions:
     * 0-30: Accept automatically
     * 31-70: Flag for review
     * 71-100: Reject automatically
   * Adjust weights based on historical fraud patterns

3. **Implementation**
   * Create `RiskScoringService` that evaluates orders
   * Integrate at checkout completion
   * Store risk scores with orders for auditing
   * Update model regularly based on outcomes

## Account Security Measures

1. **Registration Protection**
   * Implement email verification requirement
   * Add CAPTCHA for registration and login
   * Detect disposable email domains
   * Validate phone numbers where collected
   * Check for repeated registration attempts

2. **Login Security**
   * Rate limit login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
   * Implement progressive delays between failed attempts
   * Send login notifications for suspicious activity
   * Offer 2FA for admin and merchant accounts
   * Track login locations and alert on unusual patterns

3. **Session Management**
   * Generate secure session identifiers
   * Expire sessions after appropriate inactivity
   * Implement device fingerprinting
   * Allow users to view and terminate active sessions
   * Revoke all sessions on password change

## Payment Verification

1. **Card Verification**
   * Enforce Address Verification Service (AVS) checks
   * Require CVV/CVC for all transactions
   * Implement 3D Secure for high-risk transactions
   * Store card fingerprints to detect repeated usage
   * Flag transactions with mismatching cardholder names

2. **Payment Method Policies**
   * Restrict high-risk payment methods for new customers
   * Require identity verification for high-value purchases
   * Implement velocity checks for multiple purchases
   * Monitor for card testing patterns
   * Implement pending period for non-card payments

3. **Chargeback Prevention**
   * Clearly communicate shipping timelines
   * Require signature for high-value deliveries
   * Maintain detailed transaction logs
   * Implement friendly fraud detection
   * Automate evidence collection for dispute resolution

## Advanced Protection Systems

1. **Machine Learning Detection**
   * Train models on historical fraud patterns
   * Implement real-time scoring of transactions
   * Use anomaly detection for unusual behavior
   * Continuously improve models with feedback loop
   * Set confidence thresholds for intervention

2. **Network Analysis**
   * Track connections between accounts, addresses, and payment methods
   * Identify fraud rings through graph analysis
   * Flag accounts connected to known fraudulent users
   * Monitor IP address patterns and proxy usage
   * Detect multiple accounts from same device

3. **Bot Protection**
   * Implement device fingerprinting
   * Add rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints
   * Monitor for automated browsing patterns
   * Protect inventory from hoarding bots
   * Defend against credential stuffing attacks

## Merchant Protection

1. **Order Screening Workflow**
   * Create admin interface for order review
   * Display risk factors and scores
   * Provide one-click approve/reject actions
   * Allow custom rules per merchant
   * Generate daily review queues

2. **Notification System**
   * Alert merchants to high-risk orders
   * Send suspicious activity reports
   * Provide fraud trend analysis
   * Notify about chargeback risks
   * Alert on account compromise attempts

3. **Merchant Education**
   * Provide fraud prevention best practices
   * Offer training materials on risk factors
   * Share industry patterns and trends
   * Document evidence collection procedures
   * Create chargeback defense guidelines

## Implementation Components

1. **Core Services**
   * `FraudDetectionService`: Coordinates fraud checks
   * `RiskScoringService`: Calculates risk scores
   * `RuleEngineService`: Manages and evaluates fraud rules
   * `VerificationService`: Handles identity verification
   * `AlertService`: Manages notifications for suspicious activity

2. **Database Entities**
   * `RiskScore`: Stores risk assessment results
   * `FraudRule`: Configurable rules for detection
   * `SuspiciousActivity`: Logs potentially fraudulent actions
   * `IdentityVerification`: Tracks verification requests/results
   * `BlockedAddress`: Maintains list of blocked addresses/regions

3. **Integration Points**
   * Pre-checkout validation hook
   * Post-order submission analysis
   * Registration/login security middleware
   * Payment provider advanced fraud tools
   * Admin review dashboard

By implementing these fraud prevention mechanisms, we protect both merchants and customers while minimizing friction for legitimate transactions.
