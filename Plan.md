Practical Development Strategy - Start Here
Based on the comprehensive roadmap above, here's what you should focus on first to get tangible results quickly:
First 2 Weeks - Getting Started

Basic tenant model & authentication

Create basic tenant model in the database
Implement user authentication with tenant association
Build simple login/registration pages

Simple tenant storefront homepage

Create a basic homepage template
Implement tenant-specific theming (colors, logo)
Build responsive navigation component

Admin dashboard foundation

Create simple admin layout with navigation
Build tenant settings page with basic customization
Implement user management within a tenant

This approach allows you to:

See a working storefront quickly
Test multi-tenancy at a basic level
Build the foundation for future development

The key is to implement the minimal version of each major component first, then iterate with increasing complexity. This "thin slice" approach ensures you're building a working system from day one rather than spending months on infrastructure before seeing results.
Critical Early Technical Decisions
Make these technical decisions early as they impact the entire architecture:

Tenant isolation approach: Decide between row-level vs. schema-based multi-tenancy
Authentication provider: Choose between custom JWT implementation or Auth0/Keycloak
Frontend architecture: Decide on SSR approach with Next.js and component structure
Database schema: Design core entities with proper tenant isolation
Development workflow: Set up CI/CD pipeline and environment structure

By focusing on these foundational elements first and following the incremental development order outlined above, you'll build momentum while ensuring architectural correctness from the beginning.
