# Data Layer Notes

## Tech Stack & Conventions

- **Database:** PostgreSQL (v14+)

  - Use a single database with **row-level multi-tenancy**: include a `tenantId` column on all tenant-scoped tables.
  - Consider separate schemas per tenant for extra isolation if needed.

- **ORM / Query Builder:** Prisma (recommended) or TypeORM

  - Enable strict type-safety for queries.
  - Use migrations (`prisma migrate` or TypeORM CLI) for schema versioning.

- **Connection Pooling:** pgBouncer or built-in Prisma pooling

  - Configure pool size according to service replicas.

- **Caching Layer:** Redis

  - Use for frequently read data (product catalog, configuration) and rate limiting.

- **Search & Indexing (optional):** Elasticsearch or Algolia

  - Sync products and orders for fast text search and analytics.

## Security & Best Practices

- **Encryption at Rest:** enable PostgreSQL encryption features or disk-level encryption.
- **TLS for Connections:** enforce SSL for all DB connections.
- **Least Privilege:** create separate DB roles for migrations vs runtime queries.
- **Input Sanitization:** rely on ORM parameterization; avoid any string concatenation in raw queries.
- **Backups & Recovery:** set up automated daily backups; test restore procedures quarterly.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** track slow queries, connection saturation, and replication lag via Prometheus.

## Data Migration & Tenant Onboarding

- **Onboarding Process:**
  - Create database migration templates for new tenant initialization.
  - Develop seed data generators for default catalog categories, tax rates, etc.
  - Build ETL tools for importing external product catalogs (CSV, XML, JSON).
- **Data Import Standards:**
  - Define canonical data models for products, customers, and orders.
  - Create validation pipeline to sanitize and normalize incoming data.
  - Support incremental imports for large catalogs (>10K products).
- **Migration Verification:**
  - Generate data quality reports post-migration.
  - Implement checksum verification between source and target.
  - Provide rollback capability for failed migrations.

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Query Performance:**
  - Product listing queries: < 100ms at p95 with 50 concurrent users.
  - Cart operations: < 200ms at p95.
  - Order submission: < 500ms at p95.
- **Database Scaling:**
  - Support 1M+ products across all tenants.
  - Handle 10K+ concurrent sessions.
  - Optimize for 100+ tenants on shared infrastructure.
- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Target >90% cache hit rate for product data.
  - Implement cache invalidation on product updates.
  - Use tiered caching (in-memory → Redis → database).

## Inventory Management

- **Tracking Strategy:**
  - Real-time inventory synchronization across sales channels.
  - Support for backorders and pre-orders with availability dates.
  - Reserved stock tracking during checkout process.
- **Multi-location Support:**
  - Warehouse and store-level inventory tracking.
  - Location-based fulfillment preferences.
  - Transfer and rebalancing operations between locations.
- **Notifications:**
  - Low stock alerts based on configurable thresholds.
  - Restock recommendations based on sales velocity.
  - Auto-replenishment workflows for high-volume items.

# Roadmap / To-Do List

1. **Initial Schema Definition**

   - Define core entities: Tenant, User, Product, Category, Order, Payment, CartItem.
   - Add `tenantId` foreign key to all relevant tables.

2. **Migrations**

   - Scaffold initial migration with Prisma `schema.prisma` or TypeORM entities.
   - Apply to dev and staging; verify data integrity.

3. **Seeding & Fixtures**

   - Create seed scripts for default tenants and sample products.
   - Use for testing and demos.

4. **Connection Pool Configuration**

   - Integrate pgBouncer or adjust Prisma pool settings.
   - Document pool parameters (`max`, `idleTimeout`, etc.).

5. **Caching Implementation**

   - Set up Redis client in backend.
   - Implement cache for GET `/products` and `/catalog` with TTL.

6. **Search Integration**

   - Integrate with Elasticsearch or Algolia.
   - Create index mapping for Product and Order.
   - Sync on create/update events via background job.

7. **Backup & Restore Automation**

   - Configure automated snapshots (AWS RDS or on-prem scripts).
   - Test restore on dev instance.

8. **Monitoring & Metrics**

   - Expose DB metrics: query latency, connections, cache hit rate.
   - Configure Grafana dashboards and alerts.

9. **Replication & High Availability**

   - Set up read-replicas for reporting.
   - Plan failover strategy.

10. **Data Retention & Archiving**

    - Implement archival of old orders (>1 year) to a separate table or data warehouse.

11. **Documentation**

    - Document schema ER diagrams in `docs/ERD.md`.
    - Update README with connection string examples and migration commands.

12. **Tenant Data Import Tools**

    - Build product catalog import service.
    - Develop customer import utilities with PII encryption.
    - Create order history migration tool.

13. **Inventory Management System**

    - Implement inventory tracking tables and APIs.
    - Build multi-location inventory support.
    - Create stock reservation system for checkout process.
