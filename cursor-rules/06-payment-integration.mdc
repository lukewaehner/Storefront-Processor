# Payments Integration Notes

## General Conventions

### Provider

- **Primary**: Stripe Connect (supports platform fees, KYC, payouts)
- **Alternative**: Square Connect for POS-centric workflows

### Core Flows

1. **Account Onboarding**
   - Create Stripe Connected Account (Standard/Express)
   - Redirect merchant to hosted onboarding (AccountLinks)
2. **Payment Creation**
   - Use `PaymentIntent` with `application_fee_amount` for platform fee
   - Set `stripeAccount` header to route funds to connected account
3. **Webhooks & Reconciliation**
   - Listen for `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.refunded`, etc.
   - Record gross, Stripe fee, platform fee, net payout
4. **Payouts**
   - Stripe auto-payouts on schedule; optionally display upcoming payout in dashboard

### Compliance & Security

- **PCI**: use Stripe Elements on frontend; never store raw card data
- **Webhook Verification**: validate signatures on all incoming events
- **Retry Logic**: idempotent handlers with deduplication keys
- **Audit Logs**: record all payment events with `tenant_id`, `order_id`

### Fee Reporting

- **Fields to Store**:
  - `amount` (gross)
  - `stripe_fee`
  - `application_fee` (platform)
  - `net_amount`
- **Dashboard**: aggregate fees by day/week/month per tenant and platform

## International Payment Processing

- **Multi-Currency Support:**

  - Support for 135+ global currencies with real-time exchange rates.
  - Store prices in merchant's base currency with optional display currency conversion.
  - Handle currency conversion fees and display to customers.

- **Regional Payment Methods:**

  - Europe: SEPA Direct Debit, Sofort, iDEAL, Bancontact.
  - Asia: Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayPay, GrabPay.
  - Latin America: Boleto, Oxxo, Mercado Pago.
  - Configure available methods by customer location.

- **Tax Calculation & Compliance:**

  - Integrate with TaxJar/Avalara for real-time tax calculations.
  - Support VAT, GST, sales tax based on customer/merchant locations.
  - Generate tax-compliant receipts and invoices with required fields by region.

- **Cross-Border Considerations:**
  - Handle international address formats and validation.
  - Support duty/customs pre-collection where required.
  - Implement GDPR-compliant data handling for EU transactions.
