# Mobile Strategy Notes

## General Conventions

### Approach

- **Progressive Web App (PWA) First**:
  - Focus on optimizing web experience for mobile
  - Install to home screen capability
  - Offline functionality for critical features
  - Push notifications (where supported)
- **Native Apps** (long-term roadmap):
  - React Native for cross-platform development
  - Shared business logic between web and native
  - Platform-specific UI components and interactions

### Mobile Web Experience

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-first approach to all components
  - Breakpoint system: xs (<576px), sm (≥576px), md (≥768px), lg (≥992px), xl (≥1200px)
  - Touch-friendly UI elements (minimum target size 44×44 pixels)
  - Simplified navigation for smaller screens
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Bundle size budget (<200KB initial JS)
  - Image optimization (responsive sizes, WebP/AVIF)
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Server-side rendering for fast initial load

### PWA Implementation

- **Service Worker**:
  - Offline product browsing
  - Background sync for offline cart actions
  - Caching strategies by resource type
- **Manifest**:
  - Tenant-specific branding
  - Custom icons and splash screens
  - Theme color and orientation settings
- **Installability**:
  - Promotion banner for installation
  - Tenant-configurable installation prompts
  - Installation analytics

### Native App Strategy (Future)

- **Feature Parity**:
  - Core shopping experience matching web
  - Platform-specific enhancements where appropriate
- **Platform Optimizations**:
  - iOS: Apple Pay integration, App Clips
  - Android: Google Pay, App Actions
- **Distribution**:
  - White-labeled vs. marketplace model
  - Enterprise tier: custom-branded apps
  - App store optimization strategy

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Storefront Features

- **Mobile Checkout**:
  - Streamlined checkout flow
  - Digital wallet integration (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
  - Mobile-optimized form inputs
- **Store Locator**:
  - GPS integration
  - Map view and directions
  - Store details and hours
- **Barcode Scanner**:
  - In-store price checking
  - QR code for promotions
  - Add to cart via product code scan

### Merchant Features

- **Mobile Admin**:
  - Order management on the go
  - Inventory updates
  - Sales notifications
  - Customer communication
- **In-Store Tools**:
  - Mobile POS capabilities
  - Inventory checking
  - Order lookup
  - Customer profile access
