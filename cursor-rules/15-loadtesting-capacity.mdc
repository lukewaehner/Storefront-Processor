# Load Testing & Capacity Planning Notes

## General Conventions

### Testing Strategy

- **Tools**:
  - Primary: k6 for scripted load tests
  - Complementary: Apache JMeter for UI-driven tests
  - Real-user monitoring: New Relic or Datadog RUM
- **Test Types**:
  - Baseline capacity tests (constant load)
  - Stress tests (increasing load until failure)
  - Spike tests (sudden traffic surge)
  - Endurance tests (sustained load over extended periods)
  - Scenario-based tests (mimicking real user journeys)

### Test Scenarios

- **Critical Paths**:
  - Homepage & category browsing
  - Product detail view & search
  - Add to cart & checkout flow
  - User registration & login
  - Admin dashboard operations
- **Load Profiles**:
  - Normal business hours (steady traffic)
  - Flash sale events (high concurrent checkouts)
  - Holiday season (2-3x normal traffic)
  - Marketing campaign launch (traffic spikes)

### Performance Targets

- **Frontend Metrics**:
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 200ms p95
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5s p95
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s p95
  - Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.5s p95
- **Backend Metrics**:
  - API response time: < 300ms p95 for reads, < 500ms p95 for writes
  - Database query time: < 100ms p95
  - Error rate: < 0.1% under peak load

### Infrastructure Scaling

- **Auto Scaling Rules**:
  - Trigger scale-out at 70% CPU utilization
  - Scale-in after 15 minutes below 40% utilization
  - Minimum 2 instances per service for redundancy
  - Maximum scale factor: 5x baseline capacity
- **Database Scaling**:
  - Read replicas for query-heavy operations
  - Vertical scaling for write-heavy workloads
  - Connection pooling tuned to instance size

## Capacity Planning

### Tenant Sizing Tiers

- **Small**:
  - Up to 1,000 products
  - Up to 100 concurrent users
  - Up to 50 orders per day
- **Medium**:
  - Up to 10,000 products
  - Up to 500 concurrent users
  - Up to 500 orders per day
- **Large**:
  - Up to 100,000 products
  - Up to 2,000 concurrent users
  - Up to 5,000 orders per day
- **Enterprise**:
  - 100,000+ products
  - 2,000+ concurrent users
  - Custom infrastructure planning

### Resource Allocation

- **Standard Resource Allocation**:
  - Small: 0.5 CPU / 1GB RAM per service instance
  - Medium: 1 CPU / 2GB RAM per service instance
  - Large: 2 CPU / 4GB RAM per service instance
  - Enterprise: Custom resource allocation
- **Database Sizing**:
  - Small: Shared db.t3.medium (burst capacity)
  - Medium: Dedicated db.t3.large
  - Large: Dedicated db.r5.large with read replica
  - Enterprise: Multi-AZ db.r5.xlarge with multiple read replicas

### Traffic Management

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Per-tenant limits based on tier
  - Gradual fallback under extreme load
  - Custom rate limit headers for transparency
- **DDoS Protection**:
  - AWS Shield Standard for all environments
  - AWS Shield Advanced for production
  - Custom WAF rules to block suspicious traffic patterns

2. **Performance Baseline**

   - [ ] Establish initial performance metrics
   - [ ] Identify and fix obvious bottlenecks
   - [ ] Document baseline for future comparison

3. **Auto-Scaling Configuration**

   - [ ] Configure ECS/EKS auto-scaling rules
   - [ ] Set up RDS read replica auto-scaling
   - [ ] Test scaling behavior under load

4. **Tenant Capacity Modeling**

   - [ ] Create resource usage models by tenant tier
   - [ ] Develop cost calculator for infrastructure planning
   - [ ] Implement tenant usage monitoring

5. **Traffic Management & Protection**

   - [ ] Implement rate limiting by tenant tier
   - [ ] Configure WAF rules and DDoS protection
   - [ ] Test graceful degradation under extreme load

6. **Documentation & Runbooks**
