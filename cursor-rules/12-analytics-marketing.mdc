# Analytics & Marketing Notes

## General Conventions

### User Analytics
- **Platform**: Segment to route events to GA4 / Mixpanel  
- **Events**:  
  - `page_view`, `product_view`, `add_to_cart`, `checkout_initiated`, `order_completed`  
- **User ID**: map authenticated users by `user.id`, guests by anonymous ID  
- **Dashboard**: build custom reports in Mixpanel / GA4 for funnel analysis

### Error Analytics
- **Platform**: Sentry (already instrumented for errors)  
- **Usage**: track release health, error frequency, impacted tenants  
- **Alerts**: weekly digest of top-5 issues

### A/B Testing
- **Platform**: Optimizely or Vercel Analytics experiments  
- **Flow**:  
  - Define experiment (e.g. “button color test”)  
  - Serve variant via feature flag (see Feature Flags notes)  
  - Capture metrics in Segment, analyze conversion lift
