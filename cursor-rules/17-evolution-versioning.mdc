# Platform Evolution & Versioning Strategy Notes

## General Conventions

### API Versioning

- **URI Path Versioning**:
  - Format: `/api/v{major}/resource`
  - Example: `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v2/products`
- **Version Lifecycle**:
  - **Active**: Current recommended version
  - **Supported**: Still maintained but not recommended for new integrations
  - **Deprecated**: Scheduled for removal (with timeline)
  - **Sunset**: No longer available
- **Compatibility Guarantees**:
  - Major version (`v1` â†’ `v2`): Breaking changes allowed
  - Minor version: Non-breaking additions only (handled transparently)
  - Patch version: Bug fixes only (handled transparently)

### Feature Evolution

- **Feature Flags**:
  - Use for gradual rollout of new capabilities
  - Tenant-specific enablement for beta testing
  - Fallback mechanisms for all flagged features
- **Deprecation Process**:
  - Announce deprecation at least 6 months before removal
  - Provide migration path to replacement functionality
  - Include deprecation warnings in API responses
  - Monitor usage of deprecated features to target communication

### Release Management

- **Release Cadence**:
  - Major releases: 1-2 per year (with breaking changes)
  - Minor releases: Monthly (with new features)
  - Patch releases: Weekly or as needed (bug fixes only)
- **Release Channels**:
  - **Alpha**: Internal testing only
  - **Beta**: Opt-in customer previews
  - **Stable**: General availability
- **Release Notes**:
  - Technical changelog for developers
  - Feature highlights for merchants/admins
  - Migration guides for breaking changes

## Roadmap Planning

### Roadmap Transparency

- **Public Roadmap**:
  - Quarterly updates on planned features
  - Categorized by target tenant tier
  - Status tracking (planned, in development, released)
- **Feedback Collection**:
  - Feature request portal for tenants
  - Usage analytics to inform prioritization
  - Quarterly feedback sessions with key customers

### Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Removal of fields or endpoints
  - Changes to field types or validation rules
  - Modification of core business logic
  - Always require major version increment
- **Non-Breaking Changes**:
  - Adding new optional fields
  - Adding new endpoints
  - Extending enumerations
  - Performance improvements
  - Bug fixes

### Tenant Upgrade Path

- **Version Migration**:
  - Self-service upgrade option for minor versions
  - Scheduled upgrades for major versions
  - Pre-upgrade compatibility testing environment
- **Legacy Support**:
  - N-1 major version support guaranteed
  - Extended support available for enterprise customers
  - Migration assistance included in higher subscription tiers
