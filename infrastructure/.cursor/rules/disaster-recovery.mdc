## Multi-Region Strategy

### Active-Passive Configuration

1. **Primary Region**
   * All services active
   * Primary database instances
   * Full production traffic
   * Continuous replication to secondary

2. **Secondary Region**
   * Minimal infrastructure running
   * Database read-replicas
   * Warm standby services
   * Regular testing via synthetic traffic

3. **Failover Process**
   * Database promotion
   * DNS record updates
   * Scaling up standby services
   * Configuration synchronization
   * Example for database failover:
     ```terraform
     resource "aws_rds_cluster" "primary" {
       cluster_identifier      = "aurora-cluster-primary"
       engine                  = "aurora-postgresql"
       availability_zones      = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
       database_name           = "ecommerce"
       master_username         = "postgres"
       master_password         = var.db_password
       backup_retention_period = 7
       preferred_backup_window = "07:00-09:00"
       # Enable global database for cross-region replication
       global_cluster_identifier = aws_rds_global_cluster.global.id
     }
     
     resource "aws_rds_global_cluster" "global" {
       global_cluster_identifier = "global-ecommerce-db"
       engine                    = "aurora-postgresql"
       engine_version            = "13.4"
       database_name             = "ecommerce"
     }
     
     # Secondary region replica
     resource "aws_rds_cluster" "secondary" {
       provider                  = aws.dr_region
       cluster_identifier        = "aurora-cluster-secondary"
       engine                    = "aurora-postgresql"
       availability_zones        = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
       # Link to global cluster
       global_cluster_identifier = aws_rds_global_cluster.global.id
       # No master credentials for replica
