# SLA Commitments

This document outlines the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the e-commerce platform, which vary by tenant subscription tier.

## Uptime Guarantees

| Tier | Monthly Uptime | Maximum Downtime |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Basic | 99.9% | 43 minutes/month |
| Professional | 99.95% | 22 minutes/month |
| Enterprise | 99.99% | 4.3 minutes/month |

Uptime is calculated based on:
- Availability of core services (storefront, checkout, admin)
- Measured by external monitoring from multiple regions
- Excludes scheduled maintenance windows

## Incident Response Times

| Severity | Description | Response Target | Resolution Target |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical (P1) | Complete service outage | 15 minutes | 4 hours |
| High (P2) | Major feature unavailable | 1 hour | 8 hours |
| Medium (P3) | Degraded performance | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| Low (P4) | Minor issues | 1 business day | 5 business days |

Response time is measured from the moment an incident is reported via official channels.

## Maintenance Windows

- **Standard Maintenance**: Sundays, 01:00-05:00 UTC
- **Emergency Maintenance**: As needed with best-effort notification
- **Advance Notice**:
  - Basic/Professional: 7 days for standard maintenance
  - Enterprise: 14 days for standard maintenance, 24 hours for emergency

## Compensation for SLA Violations

Service credits are issued as a percentage of monthly fees:

| Monthly Uptime | Credit Percentage |
|----------------|-------------------|
| < 99.9% | 10% |
| < 99.5% | 25% |
| < 99.0% | 50% |

## Reporting and Verification
